## How It Works

The setup follows these steps to monitor your system:
1. **Prometheus:** Collects metrics from monitored targets by scraping metrics HTTP endpoints on these targets.
2. **Node Exporter:** Exposes a wide variety of hardware and kernel related metrics from systems.
3. **Grafana:** Provides a powerful and elegant way to create, explore, and share dashboards and data with your team and the world.
