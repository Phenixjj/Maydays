![Locale Dropdown](../static/img/maydays-1.svg)

## Overview

May Days is an ambitious initiative where participants undertake the challenge of executing a new project each day throughout the month of May. This initiative aims to showcase creativity, skill, and versatility in tackling diverse challenges within a tight timeframe.

## Apprenticeship Opportunities

In addition to the daily project challenges, May Days offers a unique way to showcase your technical skills. By actively engaging in daily projects and demonstrating their abilities, participants also highlight qualities such as professionalism, adaptability, and dedication that are highly valued in apprenticeship programs.

### How to Get Involved

To participate in May Days and leverage apprenticeship opportunities:

1. **Commit to Daily Projects**: Execute a new project every day in May to demonstrate your creativity and problem-solving skills.
   
2. **Document Your Journey**: Keep track of your projects, challenges faced, and solutions implemented. This documentation can serve as a portfolio showcasing your capabilities.

3. **Engage with the Community**: Connect with other participants and mentors within the May Days community. Networking and collaboration can lead to valuable insights and potential apprenticeship connections.

4. **Showcase Your Growth**: Highlight your growth and learning throughout the month. Demonstrating consistent improvement and adaptability can make you a compelling candidate for apprenticeship programs.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Setup Node.js

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above installed. During installation, select all checkboxes related to dependencies to ensure a smooth setup process.

### Step 2: Create a New Docusaurus Site

To quickly start a new Docusaurus site, use the classic template. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-maydays-site classic
```
This command initializes a new Docusaurus site named my-maydays-site using the classic template.

### Step 3: Start Your Site

Navigate to your newly created site directory:

```bash
cd my-maydays-site
```

Then, launch the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

The development server builds your website locally and makes it available at http://localhost:3000/. Any changes you make to the site content will automatically reload the page.

## Step 4: Deploy Your Site

Once you have completed your projects and customized your Docusaurus site, it's time to deploy it online for the world to see!

### Option 1: Deploy to GitHub Pages

To deploy your site to GitHub Pages, follow the [official guide](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment#github-pages).

### Option 2: Deploy to Netlify

Alternatively, deploy your site to Netlify for a seamless hosting experience. Refer to the [Netlify deployment guide](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment#netlify) for detailed instructions.

### Option 3: Deploy to Firebase

Another option for deploying your Docusaurus site is to use Firebase Hosting. Firebase Hosting provides fast and secure hosting for static and dynamic content.

To deploy your site to Firebase Hosting, follow these steps:

1. **Install Firebase CLI**: If you haven't already, install the Firebase Command Line Interface (CLI) by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```
2. **Login to Firebase**: Log in to Firebase using the CLI by running:
```bash
firebase login
```
Follow the on-screen instructions to authenticate your Firebase account.
3. **Initialize Firebase**: Navigate to your Docusaurus site directory and initialize Firebase by running:
```bash
firebase init
```
4. **Build Your Site**: Generate a production build of your Docusaurus site by running:
```bash
npm run build
```
5. **Deploy to Firebase**: Deploy your site to Firebase Hosting using the Firebase CLI:
```bash
firebase deploy
```
